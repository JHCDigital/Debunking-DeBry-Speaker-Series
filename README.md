# The Origins of the Theodor de Bry Images
De Bry heavily depended on the few accounts he could get his hands on to inform the engravings, which allowed a great margin of imagination to run through reality. He took inspirations from [Jacques Le Moyne](Q2506658), [Jean Ribault](Q935052) and [René de Laudonnière](Q672682), who all wrote or painted their experiences in North America during the short time the French resided at Fort Caroline. Their descriptions became foundational to de Bry’s engravings of Indigenous communities in Florida. He also drew on Brazilian influences from [Hans Staden](Q61580), a German sailing with Portugal as they were trying to establish a colony in Brazil. Staden was associated with the [Tupiniquim](Q2261742), as he had recorded enough information, that was likely sensationalised, about them to appeal to the curisoity of Europeans. Similarly, [André Thevet](Q523054) and [Jean de Léry](Q348377) were both Frenchmen involved with the competing efforts of France and Portugal to establish a foothold in South America. Their writings, centered around their encounters with the [Tupinambá](Q1757881), though these accounts were also shaped by religious conflict, personal rivalry, and the authors’ differing agendas.
​
These European perspectives allowed the dissemination of heavily biased portrayals of Indigenous peoples without the cultural context of what they were seeing, interpreting, or translating to the public. As a result, de Bry’s engravings combined fragments of biased observation with imaginative embellishment, producing depictions that often reflected European fantasies more than the lived realities of the Indigenous groups they were supposed to represent.
​
## Impacts
​
Since the 1970s, scholars have known that these books are inaccurate and have been debunked and criticized for their incongruencies. One such scholar would be Jerald Milanich, who wrote *The Timucua (Peoples of America)*[^3] as well as an article titled "The Devil in the Details"[^4] that goes through why the de Bry images aren’t faithful representations. His work, along with that of other archaeologists and historians, demonstrate how the engravings misinterpret or exaggerate indigenous culture, ritual activities, architecture and social structures. Due to the fact that the de Bry images existed in a void where there weren’t any other materials like them, the engravings served as an integral piece of Europe’s collective memory. With few alternative visual sources available, Europeans relied on these images to form their understanding of Native peoples, which allowed these inaccuracies to become deeply embedded in the interpretation of Native life. With no other choices, the de Bry engravings continue to remain a reference to the Americas during early colonization today, even as scholars work to contextualize and correct the distortions they introduced. The takeaway from all of this research and how to move forward is through understanding that the de Bry images aren't valid points of reference when examining 16th century life. There must be acknowledgement for the Mocama and their history needs to be centered to understand the region's own history. As well as recognition for the Mocama's decendents that are active in the local community today through the Muscogees, the Seminoles, and Miccosukees.

# Restorative Efforts
## New 16th Century Images
Dr. Bossy and Dr. Ashley have embarked in a new project to hire Seminole and Muscogee artists in creating new images of 16th century indigenous life more accurately and authentically. They currently partnering with the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Seminole Tribe and Miccosukee Tribe to consult the project as they are descendents of the Mocama and Timucuas. The images are planned to be put on an open access digital humanities website. Dr. Ashley and Dr. Bossy have also taught three courses that work with UNF students to develop the project. This project was funded by the University of North Florida as well as some private donors.
​
## Indigenous Florida
They are working on a digital humanities site that examines the deep history of the Mocamas, Guales, and Yamasees of Northeast  Florida. It includes a digital walking tour through Indigenous Fort Caroline and information about their collaboration with the Beaches Museum.

## Hebuano Language Project
Dr. Bossy has also collaborated with Dr. Aaron Broadwell, a professor of lingusitics at the University of Florida, and his team, which included Dr. Alejandra Dubcovsky a historian of Indigenous Florida, to create an accessable site for Timucuan langauage translation work. There were a series of text to try and convert the Mocama to Catholicism thtat mostly come from the early 17th century. The texts were in both Spanish and Timucuan. Only the Spanish edition was translated because the Timucquan language was not yet reconstructed. Dr. Broadwell and his team worked to translate the entire corpus of Timucua language materials. It is the second largest corpus of Indigenous languages from the colonial period. For more see https://hebuano.com/

 # Event Reception
 The Jacksonville History Center was honored to host such an acedemic and historically rich speaker series. The event was attended by 80 people. Dr. Ashley and Dr. Bossy gave wonderful insights into dismantelling de Bry's engravings and centering Indigenous perspectives. Shawn Stermer, the JHC's research archivist, crafted an exhibit centering archeology using pottery shards and publications from the archives collection. The exhibit also included a boundary map for the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve from 1987. The event was provided refreshments by Nancy Gandy, the JHC's Merill House Coordinator. This speaker series allowed attendees to explore how the European imagination shaped centuries of misunderstanding about the Indigenous peoples of Florida, as well as learn more about the collaborative efforts underway to produce accurate visual and narrative representations of 16th century Indigenous life.
